In the graph...that we draw to represent a relation aRb (a -> b)
$$ a \rightarrow b \hspace{10pt} if \hspace{8pt} (a,b) \hspace{2pt} \epsilon \hspace{2pt} R$$
AntiSym : It's not sym (unless it's reflexive...we can ignore those)

A path in a binary relation R from element A to element B is a sequence of elements (a1, a2, ..., an) where a1 = a, an = b, and for each i from 1 to n-1, the pair (ai, ai+1) belongs to R

Cycle = if all ai's are distinct and also (An, A1) belongs to R

2 sets A and B are equinumerous if there's a bijection. A set is finite if it's equinumerous with {1,2,...,n} for some natural number n.

Countably infinite : If it's equinumerous with N, the set of natural numbers.
It's written as {a0, a1,....an, ....}.
